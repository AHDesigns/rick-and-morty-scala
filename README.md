## A small, Rick and Morty based scal excercise
use https://rickandmortyapi.com/documentation/#rest as a reference

```sh
using the rickandmortyapi, find out every episode Rick has
appeared in, and then, making the assumption that he met
every character in each episode, get a list of all the
characters Rick met.
return the results as an array of names, without duplicates
```

### Extra points
Ignore any characters met on on the `Citadel of Ricks`
